        <h1>Introductory Questions: Nicole Kedoin</h1>
        <p><b>1) </b>My name is Nicole Kedoin and I am a senior double
     majoring in communication design and marketing.</p>

     <p><b>2) </b>I really enjoy graphic design and branding, but I 
        wanted to take this class so I can apply those skills to 
     website design.</p>

     <p><b>3) </b>I have learned bits of javascript, html, and CSS but I 
     don't remember that much. I have also taken a class that used Python,<br>
     but that doesn't really apply much here.</p>

     <p><b>4) </b>One thing I hope to learn in this class is how to make 
     and aesthetically pleasing website that functions well.</p>

     <p><b>5) </b>Designing for screen will definitely be different than
     designing on paper because you have to consider how a design will look <br>
     and act on different size screens. You also have to balance design 
     elements with elements familiar to the user to help them navigate the 
     screen.</p>

     <p><b>6) </b> I think that <a href="https://aurabora.com/)">Aura 
        Bora's</a> website illustrates effective design. The landing page
     has vibrant, playful graphics that are eye catching <br> while still 
     conveying the brand. It also has moving banners which gets the 
     attention of users while also added a fun animation.</p> 

     <p><b>7) </b> I think that <a href="https://prose.com/">Prose's</a> 
     website demonstrates effective communication. The home page has a 
     clear call to action that brings the viewer further into <br> the site.
     It is also very easy to navigate the site and learn about the brand
     through both use of images and labels.</p>

     <p><b>8) </b> I think that <a href="https://www.nuabikes.com/">Nua Bikes'</a> 
        website works well. This is because the website is minimalistic and lets
     their products be the main visuals while also <br> exhibiting all necessary information
     about the products. As a result users can pay more attention to the product, making
     their buying decision easier and calmer.</p>
