        <p> <b>[Intro]</b> <br>
            I want it to be, like, messy<br><br>
            
            <b>[Verse 1]</b><br>
            I'm so insecure, I think<br>
            That I'll die before I drink<br>
            And I'm so caught up in the news<br>
            Of who likes me and who hates you<br>
            And I'm so tired that I might<br>
            Quit my job, start a new life<br>
            And they'd all be so disappointed<br>
            'Cause who am I if not exploited?<br>
            And I'm so sick of seventeen<br>
            Where's my fucking teenage dream?<br>
            If someone tells me one more time<br>
            "Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry<br>
            And I don't stick up for myself<br>
            I'm anxious, and nothing can help<br>
            And I wish I'd done this before<br>
            And I wish people liked me more<br><br>
            
            
            <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
            All I did was try my best<br>
            This the kinda thanks I get?<br>
            Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
            They say these are the golden years<br>
            But I wish I could disappear<br>
            Ego crush is so severe<br>
            God, it's brutal out here<br><br>
            
            <b>[Post-Chorus]</b><br>
            (Yeah)<br><br>
            
            <b>[Verse 2]</b><br>
            I feel like no one wants me<br>
            And I hate the way I'm perceived<br>
            I only have two real friends<br>
            And lately, I'm a nervous wreck<br>
            'Cause I love people I don't like<br>
            And I hate every song I write<br>
            And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart<br>
            And I can't even parallel park<br><br>
            
            <b>[Chorus]</b><br>
            All I did was try my best<br>
            This the kinda thanks I get?<br>
            Unrelentlessly upset (Ah-ah-ah)<br>
            They say these are the golden years<br>
            But I wish I could disappear<br>
            Ego crush is so severe<br>
            God, it's brutal out here<br><br>
            
            
            <b>[Post-Chorus]</b><br>
            (Yeah)<br>
            (Just havin' a really good time)<br><br>
            
            <b>[Outro]</b><br>
            Got a broken ego, broken heart<br>
            (Yeah, it's brutal out here, yeah, it's brutal out here)<br>
            And God, I don't even know where to start</p></div>
